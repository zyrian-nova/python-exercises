# Create a number guessing game where the user has to guess a randomly generated number.

# Requirements:

# Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
# Let the user guess the number.
# Use a loop to allow multiple attempts, providing feedback:
# "Too high" if the guess is greater than the number.
# "Too low" if the guess is less than the number.
# End the game when the user guesses correctly and display the number of attempts.
